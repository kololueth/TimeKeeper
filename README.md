# TimeKeeper
A project used to track your time spent on a project

A multi-threaded desktop program which records the amount of time spent on projects throughout your day.  In my position as a chemical technician in the R&D Department, we were required to report weekly the amount of time spent on the various project we were working.  I created this program so I could easily record my time as I switched between projects throughout the day.  One can add/remove projects and click the project to start counting the time. One can also adjust the project start time and schedule the project end time through the user interface.
